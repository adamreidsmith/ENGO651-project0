## Description

This repository composes a simple personal website describing a bit about me and my interests.  It consists of four pages: a home/about page, a page on my sport interests, a photo gallery, and a contact page.  The webpage was created using HTML and CSS, with bootstrap 4 and Sass to extent the functionality and improve the code. Acess the site [here](https://adamreidsmith.github.io/ENGO651-project0/).
