ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

## Description

This repository composes a simple personal website describing a bit about me and my interests.  It consists of four pages: a home/about page, a page on my sport interests, a photo gallery, and a contact page.  The webpage was created using HTML and CSS, with bootstrap 4 and Sass to extent the functionalist and improve the code.
