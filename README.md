ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

## Description

This repository composes a simple personal website describing a bit about me and my interests.  It consists of four pages: a home/about page, a page on my sport interests, a photo gallery, and a contact page.  The webpage was created using HTML and CSS, with bootstrap 4 and Sass to extent the functionality and improve the code. Acess the site [here](https://adamreidsmith.github.io/ENGO651-project0/).

## File descriptions

The files [index.html](./index.html), [sport.html](./sport.html), [photos.html](./photos.html), and [contact.html](./contact.html) contain the HTML code for the home, sport, photo gallery, and contact pages respectively.  CSS styling for all the pages is included in the [style.scss](./style.scss) file.  The [media](./media) directory contains all images and icons that are displayed on the webpage.

## Project requirements

This project satisfies all requirements:
* The website contains 4 pages, and each page is accessable from each other page via the navigation bar in the top left.
* The [contact.html](./contact.html) page uses an unordered list to display my contact information, a table is used to display recent race results in the [sport.html](./sport.html) page, and several images are dispalyed throughout the site particularly on the [photos.html](./photos.html) page.
* The styling is contained in [style.scss](./style.scss), which is converted into [style.css](./style.css) by Sass.
* Many CSS preoperties and selectors are utilized in [style.scss](./style.scss). Some examples of types of selectors I used are:
    * element1, element2
    * element1 element2
    * .class
    * #id
    * element1 > element2
    * element:hover
